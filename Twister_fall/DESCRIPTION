This game will be a block based game where blocks will be falling down
each one will be a different color and you have to match the collors.

also they will have random numbers at which you can increase or decrease 
based on which way you rotate them.

As the progress they build up points and they can buy power ups with them.

the block with the highest number changes the collor of the bottom block
makes turns into one block of that collor.

when the blocks reach 10 they turn black and no longer can blend.

different things to think about(blocks are):
-different collors but the same number
	
-same collor different numbers
	add the numbers up creat one block

-same collor same number
	disapear
-differenct collor different number
	highest number changes the block collor
	bottom block gets the numbers added up
