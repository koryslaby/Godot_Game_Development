# Godot_Game_Development
What you see here is my first attempt at moble game development.

Twister Fall:
- Game mostly complete Still need to add font. 

Jumper Squish:
- Work in progress
- Everything with test textures at the moment.
- Working on levels that will squish the player. Testing out what object would work the best.
- Working on Player. Have tested out different Collision Objects and decided on a rigidbody2d.
